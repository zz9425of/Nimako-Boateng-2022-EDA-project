### Abstract

Diabetes is a chronic health condition that affects how your body turns food into energy. Most of the food you eat is broken down into glucose and released into your bloodstream. When your blood sugar goes up, it signals your pancreas to release insulin. Although not everyone with type 2 diabetes is overweight, obesity and an inactive lifestyle are two of the most common causes of type 2 diabetes. These things are responsible for about 90% to 95% of diabetes cases in the United States. I am interested in finding out if there is a correlation between risk factors and age. To answer this question, I will use the publicly available Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) from CDC. These results could better help current and future research efforts pertaining to type 2 diabetes. 

##Introduction
 
Body mass index (BMI) is a measure of body fat based on height and weight that applies to adult men and women. Maintaining a healthy weight is important for not only your overall health, but also for your risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

## Methods
In order to analyze the data from BRFSS, RStudio software was used to create....
