### Abstract

Abstract
Diabetes is a chronic health condition that affects how your body turns food into energy. Most of the food you eat is broken down into glucose and released into your bloodstream. When your blood sugar goes up, it signals your pancreas to release insulin. Although not everyone with type 2 diabetes is overweight, obesity and an inactive lifestyle are two of the most common causes of type 2 diabetes. These things are responsible for about 90% to 95% of diabetes cases in the United States. Is there a correlation between risk factors and age? A data set from BRFSS prevalence data will be used. In conjunction with the data set and exploratory data analysis process, the correlation between the risk factor and age will be determined. Based on the results, this could better help current and future research efforts pertaining to type 2 diabetes.
