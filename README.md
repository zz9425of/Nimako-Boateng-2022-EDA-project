### Abstract

Diabetes is a chronic health condition that affects how your body turns food into energy. Most of the food you eat is broken down into glucose and released into your bloodstream. When your blood sugar goes up, it signals your pancreas to release insulin. Although not everyone with type 2 diabetes is overweight, obesity and an inactive lifestyle are two of the most common causes of type 2 diabetes. These things are responsible for about 90% to 95% of diabetes cases in the United States. I am interested in finding out if there is a correlation between risk factors and age. To answer this question, I will use the publicly available Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) from CDC. These results could better help current and future research efforts pertaining to type 2 diabetes. 

##Introduction
 
You may have heard that unhealthy eating habits or being overweight means, you’ll develop type 2 diabetes. While those factors increase your risk, the cause of type 2 diabetes is much more complex than that. Some risk factors you may have some control over. Being overweight can lead to insulin resistance which can then lead to type 2 diabetes. It’s not just the extra weight, but where you carry it that matters. Extra fat in the belly area, which is called visceral fat, is linked to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. One reason is that visceral fat secretes retinol-binding protein 4, which increases insulin resistance, according to Diabetes.co.uk. Body mass index (BMI) is a measure of body fat based on height and weight that applies to adult men and women. Maintaining a healthy weight is important for not only your overall health, but also for your risk of developing type 2 diabetes. 

## Methods

In order to analyze the data from BRFSS, RStudio software was used to read and filter the data. After doing this, the goal is to create a graph showing the results.
(flow chart was created to show methods step-by-step)


## Discussions

In this project, data was gathered from the CDC. Data included BMI levels that correlate to obesity, age, and whether or not an individual has type 2 diabetes. This data was later plugged into R to see whether there is a correlation in the data. The data shows there is a corelation between BMI, age, and type 2 diabetes. Diabetes affects almost 30 million Americans, according to estimates from 2014. In other words, one out of every ten members of our family, friends, or neighbors is infected. Diabetes can harm your heart, blood vessels, eyes, kidneys, and nerves if it is not managed properly (United Family Medicine, 2017). This is why it is critical to get tested for diabetes and to take actions to avoid it if you are found to be at risk. According to the data, if you are over 20 years old, overweight, or obese, you are at a greater risk of acquiring type 2 diabetes. Future research efforts can suggest why is type 2 diabetes prevalent in the U.S. and those over 20 years of age.
